### Duck Hunt by Simon Bradlow

DEMO VIDEO: https://uvmoffice-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/sbradlow_uvm_edu/EUzv131l2bRKioouB1vEC1UBSJ-xDdC10Lkhzlkc6s84tw?e=SIdIpG


- Summary of the program:
  - This program is a faux-recreation of the classic NES game Duck Hunt! Taking some inspiration from flappy bird, this game is an infinite loop, with no win condition, but only a game over condition. 
  - The sprite.h class uses the python script spriteConverter.py to turn .png files into vectors of rect objects to create a sprite grid. This allows us to draw very complex images, as opposed to the usual shapes used in the classes for previous projects.


- Description of the concepts used and which modules they came from:
  - Module 2: C++ Has-A and Is-A class relationships, polymorphism
  - Module 3: Command line interface, multiple programming languages
  - Module 4: C++ Graphics (keyboard and mouse input, integrating with C++ classes)


- Operating system(s) you have run the project on:
  - macOS Catalina 10.15.7
  

- Any added installations necessary to run the program:
  - GLFW: https://www.glfw.org/download
    - Windows: see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12886609/setting-up-glfw-with-mingw for installation guidance
    - macOS: `brew install GLFW` in the command line
  - CV2: `pip3 install opencv-python` in the command line


- Any citations from code not authored by yourselves or the instructor:
  - None! BUT sprite png files were sourced from the following site and subsequentely edited: 
    - https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/duckhunt/

- What grade you think you deserve and how it satisfies the rubric items:
  - Honestly, this is a tough question to answer. developing a pixel-art based 2d game in C++ has been a goal of mine for a long time, so finally being able to accomplish it, I worked very hard to make sure it was a product I am proud of, and it certainly is. The design is well thought out, well documented, and all the ideas are implemented in ways that make sense. The code has beautiful style, the program itself is very user friendly and the inputs are fool-proof. The scope of the project, given the addition of the sprite.h class, is much larger than that of an open ended project, and I put a lot of effort into thinking through these problems in order to achieve a desireable result. Given all of this, I personally believe this to be a 200 point project.
